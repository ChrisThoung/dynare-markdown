# dynare-markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) pre-processor for
[Dynare](http://www.dynare.org/), implemented as a Python package: `dynaremd`.

As with other
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
approaches, users can write both their model code and their
documentation/equations in Markdown files. Those files are the basis for both
the final document (e.g. as a PDF file, using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)) and
the model definition file for Dynare.
